### 🏙️  Mission Statement 
NoNoise NYC is dedicated to promoting a quieter world, one community at a time. We recognize the detrimental effects that noise pollution has on the mental, physical, and financial well-being of our members in low-income neighborhoods. Through community engagement and accountability, we strive to create healthier and safer environments for all. Our organization is committed to addressing the issue of disproportionately high noise levels in low-income areas, as revealed by historical data.

### 😀 Who do we serve 
NoNoise NYC primarily serves low-income adults or undocumented immigrants who may not have the resources to mitigate the noise pollution in their communities.

### 📱 Product Overview
NoNoise NYC is a community-based application that displays an interactive heat map that shows Noise pollution levels across the five boroughs of New York City. The application also comes equipped with the functionality to automatically alert users using built in decibel meters when Noise Pollution levels around them may be affecting their health. Additional features of the application allow users to submit complaints directly to New York City's 311(non-violence hotline ) about incidents of excessive noise. Finally, users can post questions, comment, and privately chat with each other about cases of noise pollution in their communities.

### 📝 Summary
Noise pollution has become a pervasive part of modern society, but it is often overlooked. "More than 30 million people in the U.S. have hearing loss due to exposure to loud noise. In New York City, nearly one in six adults report ringing in their ears or hearing loss." (Source: New York City Health Website). These statistics are only forecasted to become worse as the population grows and becomes more industrialized. Technology, however, has the potential to mitigate these effects by providing residents with the means to stay aware at all times and hold each other accountable. This would be one of the most realistic ways to mitigate the problem and possibly implement or lobby for policy change to reduce noise pollution. A quieter world is a better world. This is the slogan of NoNoise NYC. Silence and peace have been proven to increase productivity, health, focus, and most importantly, mental health. These are all aspects society needs for an overall better society.

### 😞 The Problem 
Noise pollution levels across all five boroughs of New York City collectively make New York City one of the noisiest cities in the entire United States. Noise pollution isn't evenly distributed, low-income neighborhoods which overwhelmingly house people of color tend to experience a higher frequency of Noise pollution compared to affluent neighborhoods when data from the New York City data bank was examined. Numerous research has suggested that noise seeps into all aspects of our life and can even reduce productivity, life spans, and overall health.

### 😊 Our Solution
NoNoise NYC is a public community-based platform that allows members of low-income New York City neighborhoods to not only help hold each other accountable by posting and chatting with each other but also allows users to directly view the cause and effect of reducing noise pollution through their actions by using the interactive noise pollution heatmap.  Complaints filed through the application would automatically show that users are aware of noise pollution around them which would cause them to be rewarded with badges to entice more awareness and accountability.


### 🧗‍♂️ Key Technical Challenge
Technical challenges include implementing a live chat feature between users, creating an interactive heat map of noise pollution levels across the five boroughs of New York Cityby using an API front the New York City Data bank,  as well as allowing users to make Noise complaints directly to New York City's 311 hotlines.

Heat Map challenges
A mapping library, such as Leaflet or Google Maps, to display the heatmap on a map of NYC.
A data visualization library, such as D3.js or Chart.js, to create the heatmap itself.
A library for handling HTTP requests and responses, such as Axios, to interact with the NYC data bank API from the front-end.
A library for handling asynchronous operations, such as async/await, to ensure smooth performance of the application.
A library for routing and handling user inputs, such as Angular-router, to create a smooth user experience.
A library for styles, such as Bootstrap or Materialize, to make the app responsive and user friendly.

### +++ Extension Opportunities 
Extension opportunities include creating a system in which users can invite friends to join the application or implementing a system where users earn badges based on the number of noise complaints a particular user has made in a 30-day period.
